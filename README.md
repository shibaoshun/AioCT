## Training and Testing
Training and Testing codes for RSEN, SAM and RepFormer are provided in their respective directories.
+ RSEN: Rain streak estimation network to estimate rain streak information.
+ SAM: Segment anything to estimate image edges.
+ RepFormer: Remove rain streaks using rain streaks and image edges.
## Dataset
We train and test our RepFormer in Rain100L, Rain200L. The download links of datasets are provided.
+ Rain100L: 200 training pairs and 100 testing pairs. Download from [Datasets](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16n5hKHkr2rKlz2kBlI5JSQ?pwd=wxdm).
